<h3>Using the signing tool with Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge</h3>

<p class="dsshelpanswer">Neither Google Chrome nor Microsoft Edge supports the
Java plugin. If you want to use our signing tool to sign the form with a card or
with a certificate stored in a &quot;.p12&quot; file, please use a different
browser. Alternatively, you can keep using Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge and
use a third party application for signing electronically.</p>

<h3>Using the signing tool with Firefox</h3>

<p class="dsshelpanswer">Java may be disabled by default in your Firefox browser.
To enable it, you can follow the steps outlined below.</p>

<p class="dsshelpanswer">When you see the &quot;Activate Java&quot; message,
click it to load the Java content normally.</p>

<p><img src="images/dynforms/dssapplet/ff1.png" alt="allow Java indication"/></p>

<p class="dsshelpanswer">Alternatively, if there is no visible area to activate
Java content in the page, look for the red plugin icon in the address bar.
Click it and in the message panel that opens choose &quot;Allow Now&quot; to
enable Java content temporarily.</p>

<p class="dsshelpanswer">Note that the next time you visit the site or any other
that uses Java you will see this message again.</p>

<h3>Using the signing tool with Safari on an Apple Mac</h3>

<p class="dsshelpanswer">If you are using a recent version of Safari on the Apple
Mac, to use our signing tool you must allow our website to run in &quot;Unsafe
Mode&quot;. This will allow access to your certification card and let you save
the signed form on your computer.</p>

<p class="dsshelpanswer">In Safari, open the Preferences panel.</p>

in Unsafe Mode&quot;.</p>

<h3>Using Java versions 1.7.0_17 to 1.7.0_45 - a highly discouraged workaround</h3>

<p class="dsshelpanswer">There is a bug in the Java plugin versions 1.7.0_17 to
1.7.0_45 that prevents our service from running. We strongly encourage you to
update your Java plugin to fix the problem. A highly discouraged workaround,
that puts your computer at risk, is to lower the security level of Java.</p>

<p class="dsshelpanswer">You will have to restart your browser, so first save a
draft of your form so that you can later continue with your form submission.</p>

<p class="dsshelpanswer">Then open the Control Panel on your computer (Settings
if you are using an Apple Mac) and click on the Java icon (it might be in the
Programs folder of the Control Panel).</p>

<p><img width=624 height=338 id="Picture 14"

alt="images/dynforms/dssapplet/bug-java-1.png"></p>

<p class="dsshelpanswer">In the Security section, set the Security Level to
Medium.</p>

<p><img width=450 height=468 id="Picture 15"
src="images/dynforms/dssapplet/bug-java-2.png"
alt="images/dynforms/dssapplet/bug-java-2.png"></p>

<p class="dsshelpanswer">Then close your browser, open it again and return to
this website. You can load the form that you saved earlier and continue with
your claim.</p>

<p class="dsshelpanswer">To protect your computer, you should change the security
level back to High or Very high when you have finished using our site.</p>
