 <li><span class="dsshelpquestion">What is a digital signature?</span>

<p class="dsshelpanswer" >A digital signature plays a
similar role to a handwritten signature, namely a type of identification that
authorises data exchanged in an electronic form. A digital signature is not a
photo or scan of your handwritten signature, but a digital 'fingerprint'
associated to the document you sign, automatically computed using a
cryptographic transformation of the data in a way that allows the recipient to
verify the origin and integrity of your communication.</p>
</li>
 <li><span class="dsshelpquestion">How can I get a certificate?</span>


<p class="dsshelpanswer" >There is no single procedure
for obtaining a certificate. You may find that you have one as part of your
national identity card (only in some countries). A certificate may exist on a
card that is associated with your profession. Some banking institutions provide
certificates linked to their bank cards. Finally, you may be able to obtain one
from a dedicated provider. If you are unsure, a possible source of information
is <a

</li>
 <li><span class="dsshelpquestion">What happens to my form after
     I sign it?</span> 

<p class="dsshelpanswer" >This is a demonstration application. Your form is not kept or transmitted to other parties</p>
</li>
 <li><span class="dsshelpquestion">Can I get a copy of the signed
     form? </span>

<p class="dsshelpanswer" >You can view your form after signing it.</p>
</li>
 <li><span class="dsshelpquestion">What card can I use to sign my
     form?</span> 

<p class="dsshelpanswer" >We have tested a wide range
of cards from many countries. You can see the list of tested cards <a
href="#testedCards" title="List of tested cards">here</a>. Even if your card is not
on the list, it is quite likely to be supported - just be sure to install any
software your card provider has given you.</p>
</li>
 <li><span class="dsshelpquestion">The page keeps showing a small
     window asking me to insert a card, but my card is inserted. What's going
     on?</span> 
<p class="dsshelpanswer" >On some computers and with
some cards, you may be prompted to insert a card even if you have done so. Most
often, you can just cancel this prompt and you will be able to proceed. In some
cases you may have to cancel more than once.</p>
</li>
 <li><span class="dsshelpquestion">I have inserted my card, but
     the page tells me that there is no card inserted. What should I do?</span>

<p class="dsshelpanswer" >Be sure that your card reader
is connected to your computer and the software that supports the card reader as
well as the software that supports your smart card are properly installed (if
you just installed either software, a reboot may also be needed). Remove and
replace your card, or (on Linux or Mac computers) click the 'Read card(s)
again' button. If that fails, try starting over by following the link at the
top of the page, &quot;If you want to select another signing option, click
here.&quot;</p>
</li>
 <li><span class="dsshelpquestion">I want to sign with a
     certificate that I store in the Windows operating system. The page keeps
     asking me to insert a card, but I don't have a card. What's going on?</span>
<p class="dsshelpanswer" >On some computers you may be
prompted to insert a card even if you do not want to use a card. Most often,
you can just cancel this prompt and you will be able to proceed. In some cases
you may have to cancel more than once.</p>
</li>
<li><span class="dsshelpquestion">Why is the certificate I want
     to sign with not listed?</span> 
<p class="dsshelpanswer" >Be sure that you have
installed the software that your card provider has given you – it may be
necessary for you to start the software. Remove and replace your card, or (on
Linux or Mac computers) click the 'Read card(s) again' button. If that fails,
try starting over by following the link at the top of the page, &quot;If you
want to select another signing option, click here.&quot; If your certificate is
still not listed, it is likely that your card is not supported by this website.
In this case, you should choose the option to download the form and sign it with
another application or service.</p>
</li>
 <li><span class="dsshelpquestion">What version of Java do I need
     to use?</span> 
<p class="dsshelpanswer" >The website supports Java
versions 6 and higher. For the best experience you should use the latest Java
version. Some particular configurations are known not to work - please look in
the <a
href="#troubleshooting">troubleshooting</a> section.</p>
</li>
 <li><span class="dsshelpquestion">My browser asks me to trust
     and run an application with unrestricted access. What does this mean?</span>

<p class="dsshelpanswer" >By trusting the application,
you allow us to read the certificates on your card and to use your card to sign
the form. Otherwise this is not possible.</p>
</li>

 <li><span class="dsshelpquestion">Why do I need to use Java? </span>
<p class="dsshelpanswer" >Java is the only practical
means for us to provide an online signature tool that can support a wide range
of cards. We encourage you to use the latest version of Java to minimise
security risks. If you are unable or unwilling to use Java, we offer you the
possibility to download the form and to sign it with another application or
service.</p>
</li>
 <li><span class="dsshelpquestion">I am trying to sign with my
     card but my browser does not let me open the page. What can I do? </span>
<p class="dsshelpanswer" >It is likely that Java is not
installed on your computer or is blocked by your browser. The web page will try
to help you to install Java, but your browser may have a 'pop-up' blocker that
prevents the necessary page from opening.</p>
</li>
 <li><span class="dsshelpquestion">You say I can sign with a
     third party application or service – what applications or services can I
     use?</span> 
<p class="dsshelpanswer" >Adobe Reader is a commercial
application that can use to sign the form (<a href="#sign_with_a_digital_id"
target="_blank" title="Adobe Reader help">as explained here</a>). Your
certificate provider may also have a software tool and/or online service that
you can use for this purpose. Please check their website for details.</p>

<p class="dsshelpanswer" >Custom question 2.</p>
</li>
 <li><span class="dsshelpquestion">My card was blocked when using
     your page. Why did this happen and how can I solve it? </span>

<p class="dsshelpanswer" >A card can be blocked if the
wrong PIN is entered too many times. Your card provider may have given you a
special code ('PUK' code) that will allow you to unlock the card using software
given to you by the card provider or there may be another procedure you can
follow. In case of doubt, please contact the card provider.</p>
</li>
<li><span class="dsshelpquestion">I followed all your
     suggestions and I cannot get my card to work. What can I do? </span>
<p class="dsshelpanswer" >Please send us information
about your card and card provider. We will try to enlist their cooperation in
order to enhance our software. Note that card providers cooperate with the
European Commission on a voluntary basis.</p>
